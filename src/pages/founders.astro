	      SproutForge3D began with a simple realization that something essential was missing in science education. 
	      As a biochemist pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry with a focus in Medicinal Pharmacology at Arizona State University, 
	      I saw that even in well-equipped classrooms, students rarely had physical tools that could help them understand molecular structures and reactions in a hands on way. 
	      They were being asked to imagine what they could not see, and that limited how deeply they could engage with the material.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      That gap became my focus. I began 3D printing small prototypes such as molecular models, chemistry racks, 
	      and visual tools that could turn abstract processes into something students could actually build and explore. 
	      Those early designs did not always work. Many failed, broke, or did not fit together the way I envisioned, but each one taught me something new about design, 
	      usability, and how learners connect with science when it becomes tangible.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Over time, those countless iterations led to something greater. 
	      What started as late night experiments with a single 3D printer grew into SproutForge3D, an educational technology company dedicated to making science visible and touchable. 
	      With every product, I strive to bridge the gap between theory and experience, between seeing science and doing science.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      My goal has always been to give students access to the same curiosity that first inspired me to pursue science. 
	      Every product we create carries the same persistence, creativity, and hands on discovery that shaped my own learning and continues to drive me today.

    		While pursuing my degree in Computer Science at Arizona State University, I often found that complex concepts
    		lacked the hands on clarity needed to truly understand them. I was fortunate to have mentors and peers who helped
    		turn abstract ideas into tangible understanding, but that is not always the case. Many students do not have
    		someone to lean on when a concept does not click, and that is exactly where hands on learning becomes essential.	
	    </p>
            <p>
		When I met Esteban at Starbucks, his early prototype immediately stood out as something more than a classroom
    		tool. It was a bridge between learning and doing, a way for students to take ownership of their understanding.
    		His vision for making abstract science touchable matched my belief that real learning happens when knowledge is
    		placed directly into the student’s hands.
	    </p>
            <p>
		I joined him to help expand that vision, designing digital resources, refining classroom usability, and
    		reimagining what learning can feel like. To me, Hands is not just a kit or a company; it is a reminder that
    		discovery belongs to everyone, not just those with access to guidance or resources.
